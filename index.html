  <h1>Welcome to Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood!</h1>
  <h3>Here in the neighborhood, we like to count! But we do it a little different because we like to say silly words and make new friends!</h3>
  
  <p>We like to replace some of our numbers with silly words! Here's how it goes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any number that contains a 1, we call Beep!</li>
    <li>Any number that contains a 2, we call Boop!</li>
    <li>Any number that contains a 3, we like to ask that number, Won't you be neighbor?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Keep in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any number that contains 3 will be asked to join the neighborhood.</li>
    <li>Any number that contains 2 but NOT 3, will be called Boop!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's get started! Enter a number below and you'll get a list of all your beeps and boops and all the new friends you've invited to the neighborhood.</p>
  <form>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your number here" id="input">
    <br>

    <button type="submit">Show me all my new friends!</button>
